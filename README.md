JS Monthly Challenge Jan 15
===========================

###What's this about

The idea is to learn a new technology, code something fun and share knowledge, opinions and experience. The scope is meant to be rather small. It's something one should be able to hack together in an evening of work.

You may put as little or as much work into this as you'd like, it is encouraged to extend what you're making beyond the official challenge and to add capabilities.

###Monthly Challenge of the JS room, January 2015. 

The elected idea is [the following](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/281556/851498):
**RxJS and React**

**Task:** Use RxJS and react to implement any game based on the subject of gravity - that is the player is affected by gravity somehow. The game can be as simple (like jump every 5 seconds) or as hard as you'd like (like flappy bird a or more). 

###Submission

Submission of entries is done through pull requests to this repository. Make a pull request with a `yourusername` folder containing:

    yourUserName
      - main.go  # running this should run your submission
      - ... # any additional files required to run your submission
